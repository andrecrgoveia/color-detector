# color-detector
A simples color detector made interely with Python

You have to change the path of the archives are in your machine.

For example:
In my case I used to be the following path "/home/andrecrgoveia/Downloads"
You have to change the path like this "/home/your_path/Downloads"

After this you need to a image, when you clone this repository, I recomend that you use the image in there.

And to run this code, you have to go in the path of this code and put the following line in your terminal 'python detect_color.py --image pokemon_games.png'.

In the switch '--image' you can change the name of your image.
