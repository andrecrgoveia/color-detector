# color-detector
A simples color detector made interely with Python

To run this code, you simple are looking at the path of the archives are in your machine.

For example:
In my case I used to be the following path "/home/andrecrgoveia/Downloads"
You have to change the path like this "/home/your_path/Downloads"

After this you need to a image, when you clone this repository, I recomend that you use the image in there.
